See vimrc for an example of how to keep the tags file up to date
automatically.

Design decisions:

- Only top-level functions with type declarations are tagged.  Top-level
functions without type declarations are skipped, as are ones inside 'let' or
'where.

TODO:

- \ continuation in strings is not parsed correctly.

- Type families and associated types.

- Literate haskell.

- Entire module indented.  But who does this?
