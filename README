See vimrc for an example of how to keep the tags file up to date
automatically.

Design decisions:

- Only top-level functions with type declarations are tagged.  Top-level
functions without type declarations are skipped, as are ones inside 'let' or
'where.

TODO:

- Apparently a performance problem in some codebases.  Run on ghc, download
big projects from hackage, etc.

- Type families and associated types.

- GADTs

- better dropDups:

dd _   []     = []
dd key (x:xs) = go x xs
 where go a []     = [a]
       go a (b:bs)
        | key a == key b = go a bs
        | True           = a : go b bs

- \ continuation in strings is not parsed correctly.

- Literate haskell.

- Entire module indented.  But who does this?
