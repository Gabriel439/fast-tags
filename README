See vimrc for an example of how to keep the tags file up to date
automatically.

Design decisions:

- Only top-level functions with type declarations are tagged.  Top-level
functions without type declarations are skipped, as are ones inside 'let' or
'where.

- Code has to be indented "properly", so brace and semicolon style with strange
dedents will probably confuse it.

TODO:

- Lots of files are not in UTF8.  Use ByteString with a lenient decoder?

- \ continuation in strings is not parsed correctly.

- Literate haskell.

- Entire module indented.  But who does this?
